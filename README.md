# Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ/VMIQ-2)

The VMIQ was originally developed in English by [Marks et al. 1986](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ft07980-000). It was revised by [Roberts et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1027/2698-1866/a000022), and therefore the most recent version is the VMIQ-2.

The VMIQ-2 is a 36-item questionnaire with 12 actions imagined in 3 sensory modalities (internal visual imagery, external visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery).

# Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ/MIQ-R/MIQ-3/MIQ-RS)

Originally developed in English ([Hall, Pongrac & Buckholz, 1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0167945785900065?via%3Dihub)), it was later modified as the MIQ-R ([Hall & Martin, 1997](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ft07979-000)). The MIQ-R was then revised as the MIQ-3 to distinguish between internal and external visual imagery ([Williams et al. 2012](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jsep/34/5/article-p621.xml)). The MIQ-3 is the latest version available for adults with no physical disabilities.

MIQ-3: 12-item questionnaire with 4 movements imagined in 3 sensory modalities (internal visual imagery, external visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery).

# Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ-20/KVIQ-10/KVIQ-34)

The KVIQ was developed in English ([Malouin et al. 2007](https://journals.lww.com/jnpt/abstract/2007/03000/the_kinesthetic_and_visual_imagery_questionnaire.7.aspx)). It was created specifically for people with physical disabilities.

The KVIQ is typically administered only for the affected hemibody (if there is one). If done this way, the KVIQ-20 is a 20-item questionnaire with 10 movements imagined in 2 sensory modalities (visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery). It also has a short version, the KVIQ-10, with 5 movements. If administered bilaterally, the KVIQ-34 is a 34-item questionnaire.
